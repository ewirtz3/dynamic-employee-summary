# Dynamic Employee Summary Generator

## Description

This command line application takes in a user's input about a team's manager and employees. When the user is finished inputting all team members, the application creates an HTML file that shows an organized team roster based on the information given.

There are also tests for all js files in the lib folder; all tests pass.
